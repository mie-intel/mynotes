        right: build number

    environtment:
        sdk: software development kit
            define what version of sdk should work in this source code
    
    dependencies:
        If the dependencies written by organizations, it may be continously grow
        if by single person, then prioritize it down below, because it may be not continued 

        website to search flutter dependencies => pub.dev

        list of dependencies:

        flutter:
            sdk: flutter
    
    dev_dependencies
        dependencies that used in development

dependencies for development
    adding dependencies:
        firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, firebase_analytics

    firebase_core       = kernel, the server
    firebase_auth       = user register, log in, log out, email verification
    cloud_firestore     = where we store the user log
    firebase_analytics  = to get free analytics what user see

    command:
        flutter pub add <dependencies>

To run the app on phone while coding it, we can use Scrcpy

adb (Android Debug Bridge)
    debug tool to communicate with the phone

    Steps
        1. connect the phone with the usb
        2. check if it is connected using 'adb devices'
        3. if it is unauthorized, do these following Steps
            1. Revoke USB Debugging on phone (go to the developer settings)
            2. Restart ADB server
                adb kill-server
                adb start-server
            3. Reconnect the devices
            4. It should be authorized now!
    
    with adb, we cant use Scrcpy

    adb location C:/Users/Asus/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools

To run using Scrcpy
    run
        Scrcpy
    
    if and error occured, paste this on 'build.gradle'
        android {
            defaultConfig {
                ...
                // Enabling multidex support.
                multiDexEnabled true
            }
            ...
        }

        dependencies {
          implementation 'androidx.multidex:multidex:2.0.1'  //with androidx libraries
          //implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'  //with support libraries
        }
    
    Disable screen sleeping

Configure firebase project

    then
        firebase login
        flutterfire.bat configure
            notes => don't forget to create unique id
        
    For this project, the project id are
        Platform  Firebase App Id
        android   1:785303760120:android:1ab239e3f4ed2d26a49f0d
        ios       1:785303760120:ios:6aa421b57ebbfc49a49f0d

Hot reload vs Hot Restart
    hot reload it can show any changes but doesn't restart the application you make after it is saved
    hot restart -> show any changes but everything is restarted. Rebuild the application

Statefull, stateless
Scafold => basic building structure

Configuration not found
    => allow email and password authentification on firebase

Widget flutter binding
    Future builder => do the Future
        then return a widget on builder

Installing dev_dependencies
    test
        flutter pub add test --dev
